## Publishing Strategy

### Bulk Launch — February 8, 2026

All 79 pages publish simultaneously on launch day. The complete content library — 29 reviews,
6 category roundups, 15 comparisons, 8 buyer guides, 10 activity guides, 8 knowledge base
articles, resource hub, and homepage — goes live as a fully interlinked authority site.

This approach ensures all internal cross-links work from day one, presents maximum authority
to search engines on first crawl, and avoids any risk of users landing on 404 pages from
navigation links to unpublished content.
