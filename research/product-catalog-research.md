## Key Research Findings

### Price Distribution
- Budget tier ($10–$35): Pitchers, replacement filters, filter straws, sediment filters
- Mid-range ($35–$200): Fridge filters, pitcher dispensers, under-sink RO (iSpring)
- Premium ($200–$505): Countertop RO, tankless RO, commercial-grade under-sink

### Certification Landscape
- NSF 42 (taste/odor): Universal baseline — even budget products have this
- NSF 53 (health contaminants): Mid-range and above — critical for lead/cyst claims
- NSF 58 (RO systems): Required for any RO marketing claims
- NSF 401 (emerging contaminants): Premium differentiator — only top-tier products
- IAPMO: ZeroWater's alternative certification path (equivalent rigor)

### Consumer Trends

- Countertop RO growing rapidly — no-install RO appeals to renters
- Aftermarket fridge filters losing ground as RFID locks spread (GE)
- Survival/portable category seeing emergency preparedness demand spike

### Competitive Gaps
- No comprehensive site covers ALL six categories we address
- Most review sites ignore replacement filter cost-per-gallon analysis
- Few sites provide honest cross-category comparisons (pitcher vs RO)
- Emergency preparedness angle underserved in water filter review space
