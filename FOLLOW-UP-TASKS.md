# Follow-Up Tasks (Future Sessions)

After the 29 legacy products are added with review pages, these tasks remain:

## Comparisons
Add head-to-head comparison pages between the legacy survival filter products.
High-value matchups to prioritize:

- [ ] Sawyer Squeeze vs Sawyer Mini (most popular backpacking filters)
- [ ] GRAYL GeoPress vs GRAYL UltraPress (bottle purifier showdown)
- [ ] MSR Guardian vs Katadyn Pocket (premium pump filters)
- [ ] LifeStraw Go vs HydroBlu Clear Flow (budget bottle filters)
- [ ] Platypus GravityWorks vs MSR AutoFlow XL (gravity filter systems)
- [ ] Survivor Filter Pro vs Katadyn Hiker Pro (mid-range pump filters)
- [ ] Katadyn BeFree vs LifeStraw Flex (squeeze/bottle hybrids)
- [ ] MSR MiniWorks EX vs Katadyn Vario (ceramic pump filters)
- [ ] Sawyer Select S3 vs GRAYL Tap Water Filter (tap/travel purifiers)
- [ ] LifeSaver Liberty vs GRAYL GeoPress (purifier bottles)

Can also queue these via `content-queue.yaml` for semi-automated generation.

## Buying Guides (optional)
Existing guides cover the niche broadly. Potential additions:

- [ ] "Best Water Filter for Thru-Hiking" (activity guide)
- [ ] "Best Water Purifier for International Travel" (activity guide)
- [ ] "Pump vs Gravity vs Squeeze Filters: Which Type Is Right?" (buyer guide)

## Roundup Expansion
- [ ] Consider splitting survival filters into sub-category roundups if 33 products makes the page too long (e.g., "Best Pump Filters", "Best Gravity Filters", "Best Filter Bottles")

## Product Images
- [ ] Download Amazon product photos for all 29 new products (Phase 5.1)
- [ ] Run `node scripts/convert-to-webp.mjs` for responsive variants
- [ ] Generate AI editorial images via `npm run images` (optional)
