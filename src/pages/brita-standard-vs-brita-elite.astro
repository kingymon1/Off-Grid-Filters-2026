  { question: 'Is the Brita Elite filter worth the upgrade over Brita Standard?', answer: 'Yes, for most households. The Elite costs more per filter ($14.89 vs $6) but lasts 3x longer (120 gallons vs 40 gallons). This means the Elite is actually cheaper per gallon at about $0.12/gallon vs $0.15/gallon for Standard. Plus, the Elite removes 99% of lead and 30+ contaminants — a massive upgrade in filtration. The only reason to stay with Standard is if you prefer faster flow speed.' },
  { question: 'Do Brita Elite filters fit all Brita pitchers?', answer: 'Yes. Brita Elite filters are compatible with all Brita pitchers and dispensers except the Stream series. If you currently use Brita Standard filters, you can switch to Elite without buying a new pitcher. They use the same mounting mechanism.' },
  { question: 'Why is the Brita Standard cheaper but has more reviews?', answer: 'The Brita Standard has been on the market much longer and is the default filter included with Brita pitchers. With 95,000+ reviews, it is the most-reviewed water filter product on Amazon. The Elite (formerly called Longlast) is newer and has 38,000+ reviews. Both are proven, but the Standard has had more time to accumulate reviews.' },
  { question: 'Does the Brita Standard filter remove lead?', answer: 'No. The Brita Standard has only NSF 42 certification, which covers chlorine taste and odor. It does not certify for lead, pharmaceuticals, or other health contaminants. If lead reduction is important — especially in homes with older plumbing — the Elite is the correct choice with its NSF 42/53/401 certification and 99% lead reduction.' },
  { question: 'Why is the Brita Elite filter slower than the Standard?', answer: 'The Elite uses a denser activated carbon block with pleated media that provides much more thorough filtration. This denser media creates more resistance to water flow, resulting in slower filtering speed. The Standard uses a looser granulated carbon and ion exchange design that water passes through more quickly. The trade-off is faster flow for less filtration or slower flow for more comprehensive contaminant removal.' },
  { question: 'How much do Brita Standard and Elite filters cost per gallon?', answer: 'At $17.98 for 3 filters (40 gallons each = 120 gallons total), Brita Standard costs about $0.15 per gallon. At $29.78 for 2 filters (120 gallons each = 240 gallons total), Brita Elite costs about $0.12 per gallon. Despite the higher upfront price, the Elite is actually 20% cheaper per gallon due to its 3x longer filter life.' },

  <h1>Brita Standard vs Brita Elite: Which Filter Is Better in {year}?</h1>

  <div class="verdict-card">
    <p><strong>Quick Verdict:</strong> The <strong>Brita Elite ($29.78/2-pack)</strong> is the smarter buy for nearly everyone. It removes 99% of lead and 30+ contaminants, lasts 3x longer per filter, and is actually <em>cheaper per gallon</em> than the Standard despite a higher sticker price. The <strong>Brita Standard ($17.98/3-pack)</strong> only makes sense if you prioritize fast filtering speed over contaminant reduction.</p>

  <p class="lead">Every Brita pitcher owner eventually faces this choice: stick with the Standard filters that come in the box, or upgrade to the Elite (formerly Longlast) for better filtration? After analyzing the numbers, the Elite is the clear winner on almost every metric that matters.</p>

  <h2>Category-by-Category Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Filtration Quality</h3>
  <p>This is where the Elite earns its name. The Brita Elite carries NSF 42/53/401 certification and removes 99% of lead, plus asbestos, benzene, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and 30+ total contaminants. The Standard has only NSF 42 — covering chlorine taste and odor, copper, cadmium, mercury, and zinc. It does not certify for lead, which is arguably the most important contaminant for household water safety. If you have older plumbing or live in an area with known lead concerns, the Standard is inadequate.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: Brita Elite (30+ contaminants vs basic chlorine)</div>

  <h3>Filter Life &amp; Capacity</h3>
  <p>Each Elite filter handles 120 gallons — exactly 3x the Standard's 40-gallon capacity. This means one Elite filter lasts about 6 months versus 2 months for a Standard. With a 2-pack of Elite filters, you get a full year of filtration. With a 3-pack of Standard, you get 6 months. Fewer filter changes mean less hassle, less waste, and less time spent remembering to buy replacements.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: Brita Elite (120 gal vs 40 gal per filter)</div>

  <h3>Cost Per Gallon</h3>
  <p>Despite the higher upfront price, the Elite actually saves you money per gallon. The Standard 3-pack at $17.98 provides 120 total gallons, costing $0.15/gallon. The Elite 2-pack at $29.78 provides 240 total gallons, costing $0.12/gallon. That is a 20% savings per gallon with the Elite. Over a year of heavy use (3 gallons/day = ~1,095 gallons), the Elite costs roughly $131 versus $164 for the Standard — a $33 annual savings.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: Brita Elite ($0.12/gal vs $0.15/gal)</div>

  <h3>Filtering Speed</h3>
  <p>This is the one category where the Standard clearly wins. Brita Standard filters use a loose granulated carbon and ion exchange resin that water passes through quickly. The Elite uses a denser activated carbon block with pleated media that provides thorough filtration but noticeably slower flow. If you frequently fill and immediately pour, the Standard is more convenient. The Elite can take several minutes longer to filter a full pitcher.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: Brita Standard (faster flow rate)</div>

  <h3>Availability &amp; Convenience</h3>
  <p>Both filters are widely available at every major retailer and online. The Standard has been around longer and is available in more pack sizes (3, 4, 6, 10 packs). The Elite is available in 2 and 3 packs. The Standard's 95,000+ reviews and 4.7 stars reflect its massive install base and consistent quality. The Elite's 38,000+ reviews and 4.5 stars are also excellent. Both are easy to find and purchase.</p>
