  { question: 'What is the difference between the Pentair Everpure H-1200 and H-300?', answer: 'The H-1200 is a replacement cartridge set (twin cartridges, $390) for an existing H-1200 filter head, offering 1,000-gallon capacity with NSF 42/53/401 certification including PFOA/PFOS removal. The H-300 is a complete system ($505) that includes the filter head, single cartridge, faucet, and all hardware, but has only 300-gallon capacity and NSF 42/53 certification.' },
  { question: 'Do I need a filter head already installed for the H-1200 cartridges?', answer: 'Yes. The H-1200 at $390 is a replacement cartridge set only — it requires the Everpure H-1200 filter head already installed under your sink. If you are starting from scratch, you need either the H-300 complete system or purchase the H-1200 filter head separately and then install these cartridges.' },
  { question: 'Why is the H-1200 cartridge set cheaper than the H-300 complete system?', answer: 'The H-300 at $505 includes the filter head housing, dedicated faucet, tubing, and all installation hardware — everything you need for a brand-new install. The H-1200 at $390 is just the twin replacement cartridges. If you already own the H-1200 system, the cartridges are the only ongoing cost.' },
  { question: 'Which Pentair Everpure model removes more contaminants?', answer: 'The H-1200 cartridges have broader certification — NSF 42/53/401, which covers PFOA, PFOS, and pharmaceuticals in addition to lead, cysts, and chlorine. The H-300 has NSF 42/53, which covers lead, cysts, and chlorine but lacks the 401 certification for emerging contaminants.' },
  { question: 'Are Pentair Everpure filters really used in restaurants?', answer: 'Yes. Pentair Everpure is the dominant commercial water filtration brand, used by Starbucks, McDonald\'s, Subway, and thousands of independent restaurants worldwide. Their systems are designed for the high-volume, high-reliability demands of food service. The home models use the same core technology.' },

  <h1>{productA.name} vs {productB.name}: Which Is Better in {year}?</h1>

  <div class="verdict-card">
    <p><strong>Quick Verdict:</strong> If you already own a Pentair Everpure system, the <strong>H-1200 cartridge set ($390)</strong> is the better long-term investment with 3x the capacity and broader NSF certifications. If you are starting from scratch and want a ready-to-install system, the <strong>H-300 ($505)</strong> gets you everything in one box — but at a higher per-gallon cost.</p>

  <h2>At a Glance</h2>
  <ComparisonTable products={tableProducts} />

  <p class="lead">These are two very different products from the same commercial-grade brand. The H-1200 is a replacement cartridge set for existing systems, while the H-300 is a complete system. Understanding what you need — cartridges or a full installation — is the first step in choosing between them.</p>

  <h2>Category-by-Category Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Filtration &amp; Certifications</h3>
  <p>Both products use Pentair's Micro-Pure activated carbon with precoat submicron technology at 0.5-micron filtration. However, the H-1200 cartridges carry NSF 42/53/401 certification, covering PFOA, PFOS, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides in addition to the standard lead, cysts, and chlorine reduction. The H-300 system carries only NSF 42/53. The 0.5-micron rating on both models is exceptionally fine — most residential filters operate at 1-5 microns — which is why Everpure systems are trusted in commercial food service where waterborne pathogens pose serious liability concerns. If your water supply has known PFAS contamination or you want the broadest contaminant coverage, the H-1200 cartridges are the superior choice.</p>

  <h3>Capacity &amp; Filter Life</h3>
  <p>The H-1200 twin cartridge set provides 1,000 gallons of capacity — more than 3x the H-300's 300-gallon capacity. For an average household using 2-3 gallons of filtered water daily, the H-1200 lasts roughly 12 months while the H-300 may need replacement in 4-6 months. This significantly impacts long-term replacement costs and convenience. The twin-cartridge design of the H-1200 also helps maintain consistent water pressure as the filter media loads with contaminants, whereas the H-300's single cartridge can exhibit noticeable flow rate decline in the final weeks before replacement.</p>

  <h3>Price &amp; Value</h3>
  <p>The H-1200 cartridges cost $390 for 1,000 gallons, working out to roughly $0.39 per gallon. The H-300 complete system costs $505 for 300 gallons (with the first cartridge), or about $1.68 per gallon for the initial cartridge. However, the H-300's price includes the filter head, faucet, and all installation hardware — things you would need to purchase separately for the H-1200. For an existing Everpure owner, the H-1200 is far more economical. For a first-time buyer, the H-300 is the simpler, all-in-one option.</p>

  <h3>Ease of Installation</h3>
  <p>The H-300 is the clear winner for new installations. It includes everything needed: filter head, cartridge, dedicated faucet, tubing, and mounting hardware. A handy homeowner can complete the installation in 1-2 hours. The H-1200 cartridge set is just the cartridges — quarter-turn replacements that take 30 seconds if you already have the filter head installed. But if you don't own an Everpure system yet, you need to source the H-1200 filter head separately, which adds complexity and cost.</p>

  <h3>Long-Term Cost of Ownership</h3>
  <p>For ongoing operation, the H-1200 wins decisively. At $390 per year (one cartridge set) for 1,000 gallons, it costs less per gallon than the H-300's replacement cartridges. The H-300's single-cartridge replacements run roughly $150-180 each at 300 gallons, meaning you might spend $300-360 per year for the same amount of filtered water. The H-1200's twin-cartridge design also provides more consistent flow rates and redundancy.</p>
