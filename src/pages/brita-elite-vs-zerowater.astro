  { question: 'Is ZeroWater really better than Brita Elite for filtration?', answer: 'ZeroWater removes more total dissolved solids (TDS) — achieving 0 TDS, which Brita cannot match. However, Brita Elite removes 99% of lead and is NSF 42/53/401 certified for 30+ contaminants including pharmaceuticals. ZeroWater is IAPMO certified for lead, PFOA, PFOS, and chromium. Both are excellent, but ZeroWater goes further on TDS while Brita Elite has broader NSF certifications.' },
  { question: 'Why do ZeroWater filters cost so much more per gallon than Brita Elite?', answer: 'ZeroWater\'s 5-stage ion exchange technology achieves 0 TDS but exhausts the filter resin much faster — each filter only lasts 15-25 gallons depending on your source water TDS, compared to 120 gallons for Brita Elite. In high-TDS areas, ZeroWater filters may last only 2-3 weeks. This rapid depletion drives the high per-gallon cost.' },
  { question: 'Does ZeroWater remove fluoride?', answer: 'Yes. ZeroWater\'s 5-stage ion exchange process removes fluoride along with virtually all other dissolved solids. Brita Elite does not specifically target fluoride removal. If fluoride reduction is important to you, ZeroWater is one of the few pitcher filters that can accomplish this.' },
  { question: 'Why does ZeroWater taste different from Brita Elite?', answer: 'ZeroWater removes ALL dissolved minerals, producing water with 0 TDS. Many people describe this as a flat, empty taste because the beneficial minerals that give water its character are stripped out. Brita Elite leaves some minerals intact, which most people find produces a more natural, pleasant taste. Taste preference is subjective — some people prefer ultra-pure, while others prefer mineral-balanced.' },
  { question: 'Can I use ZeroWater filters in a Brita pitcher?', answer: 'No. ZeroWater and Brita use completely different filter designs and pitcher mechanisms. ZeroWater filters only work in ZeroWater pitchers and dispensers, and Brita filters only work in Brita products. The two systems are not cross-compatible.' },
  { question: 'How do I know when to replace a ZeroWater filter?', answer: 'ZeroWater includes a TDS meter with their pitchers. When the TDS reading of filtered water reaches 006 or higher, it is time to replace the filter. This is more precise than Brita\'s time-based or gallon-based recommendation. The drawback is that in high-TDS areas (200+ ppm), you may need to replace filters every 2-3 weeks.' },

  <h1>Brita Elite vs ZeroWater: Which Pitcher Filter Is Better in {year}?</h1>

  <div class="verdict-card">
    <p><strong>Quick Verdict:</strong> The <strong>Brita Elite ({getPriceTier(productA.price)})</strong> is the better choice for most households — it removes 99% of lead, lasts 120 gallons per filter, and delivers among the lowest cost-per-gallon in the pitcher category. <strong>ZeroWater ({getPriceTier(productB.price)})</strong> achieves deeper TDS reduction (0 ppm) and removes fluoride, but filters deplete 5-8x faster and running costs are dramatically higher. Choose ZeroWater only if you need maximum TDS reduction or fluoride removal.</p>

  <p class="lead">Brita Elite and ZeroWater represent two philosophies: the Elite offers balanced, certified filtration at an economical per-gallon cost, while ZeroWater pursues laboratory-grade purity at the expense of filter life and ongoing costs. Both are significant upgrades over basic pitcher filters.</p>

  <h2>Category-by-Category Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Filtration Depth</h3>
  <p>ZeroWater achieves what no other pitcher filter can: 0 TDS water. Its 5-stage ion exchange system strips virtually every dissolved solid from water, including minerals, metals, salts, and chemicals. The Brita Elite removes 99% of lead and 30+ specific contaminants with NSF 42/53/401 certification, but does not achieve 0 TDS. For sheer filtration depth and measurable purity, ZeroWater is unmatched. However, many experts question whether 0 TDS is actually desirable for drinking water, since beneficial minerals are also removed.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: ZeroWater (0 TDS, deepest filtration)</div>

  <h3>Filter Life &amp; Convenience</h3>
  <p>This is where the Brita Elite dominates. Each Elite filter handles 120 gallons — lasting roughly 6 months for a typical household. Each ZeroWater filter manages only 15-25 gallons before the ion exchange resin is exhausted, lasting 2-8 weeks depending on source water TDS. In high-TDS areas (200+ ppm), ZeroWater filters can die in under 2 weeks. The constant filter replacement is ZeroWater's biggest practical drawback.</p>
  <div class="winner-badge">Winner: Brita Elite (120 gal vs 15-25 gal per filter)</div>

  <h3>Cost Per Gallon</h3>
  <p>The Brita Elite 2-pack yields 240 total gallons, giving it one of the cheapest per-gallon costs in the pitcher category — pennies per gallon of filtered water. The ZeroWater 4-pack yields only 60-100 total gallons at best, driving per-gallon costs roughly 5-8x higher than Brita Elite. Over a year, a family filtering 3 gallons per day would spend a fraction with Brita Elite compared to ZeroWater, where annual filter costs can easily run five to eight times higher. That is a substantial, compounding difference.</p>

  <h3>Certifications &amp; Testing</h3>
  <p>The Brita Elite carries NSF 42/53/401 certification — the gold standard for independent testing, verified by NSF International. ZeroWater uses IAPMO certification for lead, chromium, PFOA, and PFOS. While both are legitimate certifications, NSF is more widely recognized and trusted in the water filtration industry. The Brita Elite's triple NSF certification covers a broader range of tested contaminants across three separate standards.</p>

  <h3>Taste</h3>
  <p>Taste is subjective, but most users report that Brita Elite water tastes more natural and pleasant because it retains some beneficial minerals. ZeroWater's 0-TDS output can taste flat, empty, or slightly acidic to some palates. Some people genuinely prefer ultra-pure water, but blind taste tests generally favor water with some mineral content. If you are used to spring water or mineral water, the Brita Elite will taste more familiar.</p>
