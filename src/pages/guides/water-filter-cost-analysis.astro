const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is the cheapest water filter to own long-term?', answer: `The Amazon Basics pitcher with Amazon Basics Enhanced replacement filters is the cheapest overall system. The pitcher costs ${getPriceTier(amazonPitcher.price)}, and replacement filters cost ${getPriceTier(amazonBasicsReplacement.price)} for a 3-pack (about $3.50 each). At 6 filters per year for a family of 4, that is roughly $21 per year in replacements after the initial $24 pitcher. Total 5-year cost: approximately $128. That is about $0.07 per gallon of filtered water.` },
  { question: 'Is a reverse osmosis system worth the investment?', answer: `For households with serious water quality issues (high TDS, lead, PFAS), absolutely. The iSpring RCC7AK costs ${getPriceTier(ispring.price)} upfront, but replacement filters cost only $50-$70 per year. Over 5 years, the total cost is approximately $450-$550 — comparable to a pitcher system that provides far less filtration. The cost per gallon drops below $0.05 over time, making RO the most cost-effective serious filtration option.` },
  { question: 'How does filtered water compare to bottled water cost?', answer: 'Bottled water typically costs $0.50-$2.00 per gallon depending on the brand. A family of 4 consuming 3 gallons per day spends $550-$2,200 per year on bottled water. The most expensive filtration system in our analysis (Waterdrop G3P600) costs about $0.09 per gallon — 5-22x cheaper than bottled. The cheapest option (Amazon Basics pitcher) costs $0.07 per gallon — 7-28x cheaper.' },
  { question: 'Do RO systems cost more in water waste?', answer: 'Yes, water waste adds to the cost. Traditional RO systems waste 3-4 gallons per filtered gallon, adding roughly $0.01-$0.03 per gallon at average US water rates ($0.004/gallon). Modern efficient systems like the Waterdrop G3P600 (2:1 ratio) waste less. For most households, the wastewater cost adds $10-$30 per year — noticeable but not significant compared to filter costs.' },
  { question: 'Which pitcher filter has the lowest cost per gallon?', answer: `The Amazon Basics Enhanced replacement filter at ${getPriceTier(amazonBasicsReplacement.price)} for a 3-pack, with each filter rated at 40 gallons, costs about $0.09 per gallon. The Brita Elite at ${getPriceTier(britaElite.price)} for a 2-pack, with each filter rated at 120 gallons, costs about $0.12 per gallon. Despite the higher upfront cost, the Brita Elite is competitive because of its longer filter life. ZeroWater is the most expensive at $0.60-$1.00 per gallon due to its very short filter life.` },
  { question: 'Should I factor in electricity costs for RO systems?', answer: 'Tankless RO systems like the Waterdrop G3P600 and countertop RO systems like the Bluevua models require electricity for their pumps. The energy consumption is minimal — roughly $5-$15 per year. Tank-based systems like the iSpring RCC7AK use only water pressure (no electricity), making them the most economical to operate. Electricity costs are a minor factor in total cost of ownership.' },
  { question: 'How much does it cost to maintain a refrigerator water filter?', answer: `Refrigerator filter costs depend on OEM vs aftermarket. OEM GE XWFE filters cost ${getPriceTier(geXwfe.price)} every 6 months ($99/year). OEM everydrop Filter 1 costs ${getPriceTier(everydrop1.price)} every 6 months ($108/year). Aftermarket alternatives like the AQUACREST 6-pack at $16.88 bring the annual cost down to just $5.63 — an enormous savings. The trade-off is fewer NSF certifications.` },

  <p class="lead">The price on the box is only the beginning. Replacement filters, water waste, electricity, and maintenance all contribute to the true cost of owning a water filter. We calculated the 1-year and 5-year total cost of ownership for every major filter type in our catalog — from budget pitchers to premium RO systems — so you can make a genuinely informed decision about where your money goes.</p>

  <ProductImage alt="Water filter cost of ownership analysis" icon="gear" aspect="hero" />

  <h2>The Cost Components Most People Miss</h2>
  <p>Every water filter has four cost components. Most buyers only consider the first one:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Purchase price:</strong> The upfront cost of the filter system itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Replacement filters:</strong> The ongoing cartridge cost. This is almost always the largest expense over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Water waste:</strong> RO systems produce wastewater. At average US water rates (~$0.004 per gallon), this adds $10-$30 per year.</li>
    <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Tankless RO and countertop systems need power. Adds $5-$15 per year.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our analysis assumes a family of 4 consuming approximately 3 gallons of filtered water per day (1,095 gallons per year). Adjust proportionally for your household.</p>

  <ProTip>The single biggest money-saving move in water filtration is switching from bottled water to any filter. A family of 4 buying bottled water spends $800-$2,200 per year. Even the most expensive filter system on this page costs less than $200 per year to operate.</ProTip>

  <h2>Pitcher Filter Systems: Cost Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Amazon Basics Pitcher + Amazon Basics Enhanced Filters</h3>

    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$845</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.15</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Brita UltraMax + Brita Elite Filters</h3>
  <p><strong>The smart upgrade — cheaper per gallon than Standard.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dispenser: <a href={`/reviews/${britaUltramax.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(britaUltramax.price)}</a></li>
    <li>Replacement filters: <a href={`/reviews/${britaElite.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(britaElite.price)} for 2-pack</a> ($14.89 each, 120 gallons per filter)</li>
    <li>Filters needed per year: ~9 filters (1,095 / 120)</li>
    <li>Annual filter cost: ~$134</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$169</strong></li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$705</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.12</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>ZeroWater Pitcher + 5-Stage Filters</h3>
  <p><strong>The premium pitcher — with a painful cost surprise.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pitcher: ~$35 (varies by model)</li>
    <li>Replacement filters: <a href="/reviews/zerowater-5stage-4pack/">{getPriceTier(zeroWater4.price)} for 4-pack</a> ($15.00 each, ~20 gallons per filter at average TDS)</li>
    <li>Filters needed per year: ~55 filters (1,095 / 20)</li>
    <li>Annual filter cost: ~$825</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$860</strong></li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$4,160</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.75</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>ZeroWater delivers 0-TDS purity but at a staggering annual cost. In high-TDS areas (300+ ppm), filters may last only 15 gallons, pushing costs even higher. For reference, bottled water costs roughly $0.50-$2.00 per gallon. ZeroWater can approach or exceed the cost of many bottled water brands.</p>

  <ProTip>The Brita Elite is one of the best value secrets in water filtration. Despite costing $14.89 per filter vs $6 for Brita Standard, the Elite's 120-gallon capacity means it costs less per gallon ($0.12 vs $0.15) and adds NSF 53/401 certifications (lead, pharmaceuticals) that Standard lacks. It is both cheaper and better long-term.</ProTip>

  <h2>Under-Sink RO Systems: Cost Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>iSpring RCC7AK (75 GPD, Tank-Based)</h3>
  <p><strong>The best overall value for serious filtration.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>System: <a href={`/reviews/${ispring.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(ispring.price)}</a></li>
    <li>Annual filter replacement: ~$50-$60 (3 pre-filters at $10 each, 1 post-carbon at $12, 1 remineralization at $8)</li>
    <li>RO membrane replacement: ~$25 every 2.5 years ($10/year amortized)</li>
    <li>Water waste cost: ~$13/year (1:3 ratio = 3,285 gallons waste at $0.004/gallon)</li>
    <li>Electricity: $0 (uses water pressure only)</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$272</strong></li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$558</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.10</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The iSpring's total cost of ownership over 5 years is lower than the Brita UltraMax with Standard filters — while providing dramatically better filtration (6-stage RO vs. basic carbon).</p>

  <h3>Waterdrop G3P600 (600 GPD, Tankless)</h3>
  <p><strong>The premium choice with higher ongoing costs.</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>System: <a href={`/reviews/${waterdrop.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(waterdrop.price)}</a></li>
    <li>Annual filter replacement: ~$80-$100 (CF filter every 6 months ~$30, MRO every 12 months ~$50, CB every 24 months ~$20/year amortized)</li>
    <li>Water waste cost: ~$9/year (2:1 ratio = 2,190 gallons waste at $0.004/gallon)</li>
    <li>Electricity: ~$10/year (pump requires power)</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$528</strong></li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$923</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.17</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Waterdrop G3P600 costs more per gallon than the iSpring, but you are paying for tankless on-demand water, smart TDS monitoring, and space savings. Whether the premium is worth it depends on your priorities.</p>

  <h2>Countertop RO Systems: Cost Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>System: <a href={`/reviews/${bluevua.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(bluevua.price)}</a></li>
    <li>Annual filter replacement: ~$70-$90 (RO membrane every 12 months, other filters every 6 months)</li>
    <li>Water waste cost: ~$9/year (2:1 ratio)</li>
    <li>Electricity: ~$8/year</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$404</strong></li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$751</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.12</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Lite UV offers the best value in countertop RO, combining no-install convenience with a competitive per-gallon cost.</p>

  <h2>Commercial-Grade Under-Sink: Cost Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>Pentair Everpure H-1200 (Cartridge Replacements)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cartridges: <a href={`/reviews/${pentairH1200.slug}/`}>{getPriceTier(pentairH1200.price)}</a> (requires existing filter head)</li>
    <li>Replacement frequency: Every 12 months (1,000 gallons)</li>
    <li>Water waste: $0 (not RO)</li>
    <li>Electricity: $0</li>
    <li><strong>Year 1 total: ~$390</strong> (cartridges only; filter head adds ~$100-$150 first time)</li>
    <li><strong>5-year total: ~$2,050</strong> (including initial system setup)</li>
    <li><strong>Cost per gallon: ~$0.37</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Pentair Everpure is the most expensive per-gallon option, but delivers commercial restaurant-grade filtration quality. It is best suited for those who prioritize absolute taste quality and have the budget to support it.</p>

  <h2>Refrigerator Filters: Cost Breakdown</h2>

  <h3>OEM Route (GE XWFE or everydrop Filter 1)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href={`/reviews/${geXwfe.slug}/`}>GE XWFE at {getPriceTier(geXwfe.price)}</a> every 6 months = ~$99/year</li>
    <li><a href={`/reviews/${everydrop1.slug}/`}>everydrop Filter 1 at {getPriceTier(everydrop1.price)}</a> every 6 months = ~$108/year</li>
    <li><strong>5-year OEM cost: $495-$540</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Aftermarket Route (AQUACREST 6-Pack)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/reviews/aquacrest-ukf8001-6pack/">AQUACREST 6-Pack at $16.88</a> = $2.81 per filter, 2 filters per year = ~$5.63/year</li>
    <li><strong>5-year aftermarket cost: ~$28</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The aftermarket savings are dramatic, but you give up NSF 53/401 certification (lead, pharmaceuticals). If your main concern is taste, aftermarket is fine. If you need contaminant reduction, stick with OEM.</p>

  <ProTip>If you use a refrigerator filter for ice and cold water only (not primary drinking water), the aftermarket route is a smart move. Pair it with an under-sink filter at the kitchen faucet for serious drinking water filtration. This hybrid approach maximizes filtration where it matters while minimizing cost where it does not.</ProTip>

  <h2>The Bottled Water Comparison</h2>
  <p>For perspective, here is what bottled water costs a family of 4 consuming 3 gallons per day:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Budget store brand (24-pack, $4):</strong> ~$600/year</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-range brand (24-pack, $6):</strong> ~$900/year</li>
    <li><strong>Premium brand (24-pack, $10):</strong> ~$1,500/year</li>
    <li><strong>5-gallon delivery service:</strong> ~$400-$700/year</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Every single filter system in our analysis — even the expensive ZeroWater — is cheaper than mid-range bottled water in year two. And unlike bottled water, you eliminate plastic waste, microplastic ingestion from bottles, and the hassle of buying and carrying heavy packs.</p>

  <h2>5-Year Cost Comparison Summary</h2>
  <p>Here is every system ranked by total 5-year cost of ownership for a family of 4:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Amazon Basics pitcher + Amazon Basics filters:</strong> ~$498 ($0.09/gallon) — Best budget value</li>
    <li><strong>iSpring RCC7AK under-sink RO:</strong> ~$558 ($0.10/gallon) — Best overall value for serious filtration</li>
    <li><strong>Bluevua Lite UV countertop RO:</strong> ~$649 ($0.12/gallon) — Best no-install RO value</li>
    <li><strong>Brita UltraMax + Elite filters:</strong> ~$705 ($0.12/gallon) — Best premium pitcher</li>
    <li><strong>Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV countertop:</strong> ~$751 ($0.14/gallon) — Best premium countertop</li>
    <li><strong>Brita UltraMax + Standard filters:</strong> ~$845 ($0.15/gallon) — Most popular (but not most economical)</li>
    <li><strong>Waterdrop G3P600 tankless RO:</strong> ~$923 ($0.17/gallon) — Best premium under-sink</li>
    <li><strong>Pentair Everpure H-1200:</strong> ~$2,050 ($0.37/gallon) — Commercial-grade quality</li>
    <li><strong>ZeroWater pitcher:</strong> ~$4,160 ($0.75/gallon) — Maximum purity, maximum cost</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pitcher filters are only cheap upfront.</strong> Over 5 years, some pitcher systems cost more than under-sink RO due to frequent filter replacements.</li>
    <li><strong>Under-sink RO is the best value for serious filtration.</strong> The iSpring RCC7AK's 5-year cost ($558) is barely more than a budget pitcher system, while delivering dramatically better water quality.</li>
    <li><strong>Brita Elite saves money vs. Brita Standard.</strong> Despite costing more per filter, the Elite's 3x longer life makes it cheaper per gallon. It is the rare upgrade that actually saves you money.</li>
    <li><strong>ZeroWater is extremely expensive long-term.</strong> Great for specific applications (very high TDS water), but impractical for most households at $0.75 per gallon.</li>
    <li><strong>Any filter beats bottled water.</strong> Even the most expensive filter system costs less per gallon than the cheapest bottled water brand.</li>
  </ul>
