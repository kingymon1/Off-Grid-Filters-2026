const faqs = [
  { question: 'What is the best water filter for an off-grid cabin?', answer: 'For a permanent off-grid cabin with well water or a pressurized water line, the iSpring RCC7AK under-sink RO system ($198.78) provides the most thorough filtration at the best value. If you lack plumbing or electricity, the Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV countertop RO ($317) runs off any standard outlet and needs no water line connection. For cabins relying on surface water (creek, lake, or rainwater collection), start with a gravity purifier like the LifeStraw Family 1.0 ($64.95) which removes viruses without power, then consider a countertop RO for drinking water refinement.' },
  { question: 'Do I need a purifier or just a filter for off-grid water?', answer: 'It depends on your water source. If you are on a private well, a filter (0.1-0.2 micron) handles bacteria and protozoa, and an RO system handles dissolved contaminants. If you are drawing from surface water (streams, rivers, lakes, or rainwater collection), you need a purifier that also removes viruses. The LifeStraw Family 1.0 and MSR Guardian both achieve purifier-level protection at 0.02 micron. For well water with known chemical contamination, only reverse osmosis removes dissolved chemicals like PFAS, lead, and arsenic.' },
  { question: 'Can countertop RO systems work without municipal water?', answer: 'Yes. Countertop RO systems like the Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV and Lite models work with any potable or pre-filtered water source. You manually fill the tank with water from your well, rain barrel, or pre-filtered surface water. They need electricity (standard 110V outlet) but no pressurized water line. This makes them ideal for off-grid cabins and homesteads that have solar power or a generator but no municipal hookup. Pre-filter through a sediment filter or gravity filter first if your source water is turbid.' },
  { question: 'What is the best portable water filter for van life?', answer: 'The Sawyer Squeeze ($34.97) is the best portable filter for van life because it is compact, weighs 3 ounces, and has a 100,000-gallon lifetime. For daily drinking water, pair it with a countertop RO system like the Bluevua Lite UV ($219) if your van has shore power or sufficient solar. The GRAYL GeoPress ($89.95) is the best all-in-one solution for van lifers who fill up from varied and uncertain water sources, since it removes viruses, chemicals, and heavy metals in 8 seconds.' },
  { question: 'How do I filter rainwater for drinking off-grid?', answer: 'Rainwater collection requires a multi-stage approach. First, use a roof washer or first-flush diverter to discard the initial contaminated runoff. Then pass collected water through a sediment pre-filter (5 micron) to remove debris. Next, use a gravity purifier like the LifeStraw Family 1.0 to remove bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Finally, for the cleanest drinking water, run it through a countertop RO system to remove dissolved chemicals, heavy metals, and any remaining contaminants. Test your rainwater annually for lead and chemical contamination.' },
  { question: 'What off-grid water filter works without electricity?', answer: 'Gravity-fed systems are the best choice when electricity is unavailable. The LifeStraw Family 1.0 ($64.95) is a true purifier that removes viruses, bacteria, and protozoa using only gravity, with an 18,000-liter capacity. The MSR AutoFlow XL ($64.95) and Platypus GravityWorks 4L ($74.95) are excellent gravity filters for groups. For individual use, the Sawyer Squeeze ($34.97) works by hand pressure alone. Chemical purification tablets like MSR Aquatabs ($11.99) provide virus protection with zero power requirements.' },

  <h1>Best Off-Grid Water Filters {year}: Expert Picks</h1>
  <p class="lead">Off-grid water filtration is not a one-product problem. Whether you are building a remote cabin on well water, outfitting a van for full-time travel, filtering creek water at a homestead, or preparing for emergencies at a rural property, the right setup depends on your water source, power availability, and daily volume needs. We curated {allProducts.length} water filters that cover the full spectrum of off-grid living — from sub-$25 portable filters you can throw in a pack to countertop reverse osmosis systems that purify well water without a plumber.</p>

  <h2>Quick Picks: Our Top Off-Grid Recommendations</h2>
  <ComparisonTable products={tableProducts} />

  <h2>Best Portable Off-Grid Filters</h2>
  <p>Portable filters are the backbone of off-grid water access. They require no electricity, no plumbing, and no installation. Whether you are filtering creek water at a remote campsite, purifying rain collection at a cabin, or keeping a gravity bag running at a homestead, these products handle the job with zero infrastructure.</p>

  <ProTip title="Layered Water Strategy for Off-Grid Living">
    <p>The smartest off-grid water strategy uses multiple complementary products. A gravity filter (MSR AutoFlow XL or Platypus GravityWorks) handles daily volume needs with zero effort. A squeeze filter (Sawyer Squeeze) provides fast on-demand filtration for individual use. Chemical purification tablets (MSR Aquatabs) serve as a virus-killing backup that weighs nothing and never breaks. This layered approach means no single point of failure in your water supply chain — critical when the nearest hardware store is hours away.</p>

  <h2>Best Home Systems for Off-Grid Properties</h2>
  <p>If your off-grid cabin, homestead, or rural property has electricity (solar, generator, or grid), a countertop or under-sink RO system provides the highest level of drinking water purification available. Countertop RO systems like the Bluevua models need no plumbing connection — just fill the tank with pre-filtered well water or rainwater and plug into a standard outlet. Under-sink systems like the iSpring RCC7AK connect to any pressurized water line, making them ideal for cabins with a well pump.</p>

  <h2>How We Chose Our Off-Grid Picks</h2>
  <p>Off-grid water filtration demands a different evaluation framework than home filters connected to municipal supplies. We prioritized five criteria specific to remote and off-grid living:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Power requirements:</strong> Can the system operate without electricity, or does it need solar/generator power? Gravity-fed and manual-pump products scored highest for true off-grid flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Water source flexibility:</strong> Does the product handle turbid surface water (creeks, rivers, rainwater), or does it require pre-treated water? Purifiers that remove viruses, bacteria, and protozoa from raw water sources scored higher than filters that only remove bacteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintenance in remote areas:</strong> How easy is it to maintain the filter when the nearest hardware store is an hour away? Self-cleaning systems (MSR Guardian), backwashable filters (Sawyer Squeeze), and long-life cartridges (LifeStraw Family 1.0 at 18,000L) all reduce the maintenance burden.</li>
    <li><strong>Volume capacity:</strong> Can the system handle daily water needs for a family without constant attention? Gravity systems that process 4-10 liters hands-free scored highest for daily-driver use.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost of ownership:</strong> Off-grid living is often budget-conscious. We calculated the 3-year cost of ownership including replacement filters, replacement bags, and energy costs to identify the best long-term value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Buying Guide: Off-Grid Water Filtration</h2>
  <p><strong>Match your system to your water source.</strong> Well water typically contains bacteria, sediment, and dissolved minerals but rarely viruses — a standard 0.1-0.2 micron filter plus an RO system handles it effectively. Surface water (streams, rivers, lakes) carries bacteria, protozoa, and potentially viruses — you need a purifier rated to 0.02 microns or chemical treatment. Rainwater collection is usually the cleanest natural source but can contain airborne contaminants, bird droppings, and roof chemicals — a sediment pre-filter plus gravity purifier covers it.</p>
  <p><strong>Portable vs. fixed systems.</strong> Portable filters (squeeze, gravity, bottle purifiers) require no installation, no electricity, and no plumbing. They are essential for every off-grid property as both primary and backup filtration. Fixed systems (countertop RO, under-sink RO) provide the highest purification levels but need electricity and, in the case of under-sink systems, a pressurized water line. The ideal off-grid setup uses both: a gravity filter for bulk daily water and a countertop RO for premium drinking water.</p>
  <p><strong>Solar power compatibility.</strong> Countertop RO systems draw 50-100 watts during operation. A standard off-grid solar setup (400W+ panels with battery bank) can easily handle a Bluevua RO system running a few cycles per day. Under-sink RO systems with electric pumps (like the Waterdrop G3P600) draw more power but only during use. If you have zero electricity, stick with gravity-fed purifiers and squeeze filters — they work indefinitely with no power input.</p>
  <p><strong>Think in layers, not single products.</strong> The most resilient off-grid water strategy combines multiple methods: a sediment pre-filter to protect your main system, a gravity filter or RO system for daily drinking water, a portable squeeze filter for on-the-go use around your property, and chemical tablets as an emergency backup. Redundancy matters when the nearest clean water source may be a long drive away.</p>

  <ProTip title="Off-Grid Water Testing">
    <p>Test your well water or primary water source at least once per year, and after any major weather event (heavy rains, flooding, drought). A basic water test kit ($20-$50) checks for bacteria, pH, hardness, iron, and nitrates. For comprehensive testing including lead, PFAS, and heavy metals, send a sample to a certified lab ($100-$200). This data tells you exactly which contaminants your filtration system needs to handle — and whether your current setup is adequate. Many off-grid homesteaders discover their well water has issues they never suspected until they test it.</p>

  <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
  <div class="verdict-card">
    <p>For the best overall portable off-grid filter, the <strong>Sawyer Squeeze</strong> at $34.97 is unmatched — the 100,000-gallon lifetime means you will never replace it, and it works as a squeeze, gravity, or inline filter with zero power. For families relying on surface water without electricity, the <strong>LifeStraw Family 1.0</strong> at $64.95 purifies 18,000 liters of virus-laden water on gravity alone. For off-grid cabins and homesteads with electricity, the <strong>Bluevua RO100ROPOT-UV</strong> at $317 provides hospital-grade countertop purification with no plumbing required, while the <strong>iSpring RCC7AK</strong> at $198.78 delivers the best under-sink RO value for cabins with a well pump. And every off-grid property should keep <strong>MSR Aquatabs</strong> ($11.99) as a virus-killing emergency backup that weighs nothing and never fails.</p>
